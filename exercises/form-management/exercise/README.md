# Form Management Exercises

## Code Along

We're going to take the existing, non-functional form code and modify it using Formik to build a clean, easily-extendable form component that collects information and displays submissions in an adjacent `div`. 

## Solo Exercise

* Add a form component that we haven't used yet (like select, radio group, etc.) to create an additional input on the form and display it along with the rest of the submission in the `Content` component.
* Bonus: If you have time, add a couple more form components to practice! Extra bonus for using a Formik `FieldArray` component.
