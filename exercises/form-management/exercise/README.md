# Form Management Exercises

## Code Along

We're going to take the existing, non-functional form code and modify it using Formik to build a clean, easily-extendable form component that collects information and displays submissions in an adjacent `div` - we'll get through the text input element together. 

## Solo Exercise

* Convert the checkboxes to Formik `Field` elements.
* For each technology, print a string under the submission name in the `Content` component that says "Has used [technology]"" if the value is `true`, or "Has not used [technology]" if the value is `false`.
* Add a select or radio group component to the form and nicely print the submitted value along with the rest of the submission values.
