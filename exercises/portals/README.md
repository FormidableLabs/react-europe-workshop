# Portals

## Resources
We'll be covering the basic use cases for portals and learning how to implement them with positioning based on DOM measuring methods. We won't be getting into accessibility or positioning libraries, but those are both important things to familiarize yourself with if you use portals in a public-facing project or production app. I've provided you with links to resources to get you started.

### Accessibility
* You'll want to implement focus traps and other common accessibility features for modals, tooltips, or whatever you're using a portal to implement
* [Intro to general web accessibility implementation](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/)
* A great tool to use to make accessibility implementation easier for modals and similar elements is [React-Modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal)

### Positioning
* DOM measuring is fine and pretty straightforward, but sometimes you might want a different option for tooltip positioning. One of these libraries might be what you're looking for.
