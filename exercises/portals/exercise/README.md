# Exercises

## Code Along
Our goal is to take a modal that can't break out of a parent with an `overflow: hidden` style property and turn it into a portal-based element that can live anywhere in the DOM while staying within the React Component Tree. I'll be walking you through the process to get you familiar with the basic implementation methods.

## Solo Exercise
* Add a tooltip component for the `containerDiv` element
* It should break out of the parent component using a Portal
* It should be positioned in a way that makes it obviously related to whatever element triggers it on hover or click
* It should either display information about the parent component or trigger some event within the parent component
