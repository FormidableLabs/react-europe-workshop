## Morning Session, Part 2
**Time**: 11:00AM - 12:00PM

**Duration**: 1 hour

###### Schedule

* **Compound Components Lecture** (_11:00AM - 11:10AM_)
  * Describe "compound" components
  * Component components are components that share some "implicit" state
  * Go over how they can be used to provide a set of related components that work together, with constraints
  * Component components let you share _implicit_ state
  * Implicit is state that doesn't have to be explicitly shared between components, which you'd normally do through props
  * Props are the API for explicit state
  * __Maybe have a section on implicit vs explicit state?__
* **Compound Components Exercises** (_11:10AM - 11:30AM_)
  * How to communicate implicit state
  * Talk about the OG approach of using `React.cloneElement`
    * Discuss pitfalls of `React.cloneElement`
    * Show how it breaks with deeply nested compound components
    * Generally a pattern you be aware of, but avoid if possible
  * Discuss using Context to make compound components more flexible
    * _Might have to do context lesson first?_
  * Maybe use the [Header/Section][1] example as a starting point
  * Restricting access to component components
    * Defining them as `static` properties on the parent component
    * Using a render prop to provide these components
  * Write some exercises for compound components
* **Controlled Components Lecture** (_11:30AM - 11:40AM_)
  * Describe controlled components
  * Explain how the "controlled" vs "uncontrolled" pattern can be generalized for more than just inputs
  * Go over benefits

# Unscheduled Sessions

These are some sessions that may be valuable, but that don't fit in with our current schedule.

* **Managing and Deriving State** (_N/A_)
  * What to put in state, what to derive?
  * Avoid using state as a proxy for data that can be derived from props
    * If your state is just some pure derivation of props that is _always_ synced with new props, it's not really state
  * State should be _local_ and mostly independent from props.
  * The appropriate use cases for `getDerivedStateFromProps`
  * Using memoized functions (`memoize-one` library is a good one)
  * Explain how you can use memoized component methods to derive state in `render` without having to worry about using another lifecycle
  * Using `setState` callbacks to run code after state has been updated
    * A good pattern if you need to notify some parent of local state changes (input element notifies parent in an `AutoComplete` component)
  * Using updater functions in `setState`
    * Being able to return `null` to signify that no state update is needed

* **Render-less Components** (_N/A_)
  * Components that don't actually render anything to the DOM
  * A good example of how React can let you implement a declarative API for imperative functionality
  * For example, we could make a `Speak` component using a render-less component and the `SpeechSynthesis` API
  * A "Container" component can be thought of as a render-less component, since it doesn't actually render anything new itself.
  * You can also define components that render absolutely nothing. They may have _side effects_
  * `react-helmet` is a good example (re-implementing could be an exercise)

* **Streaming Server Rendering** (_N/A_)
  * Show off `renderToNodeStream`
  * Basic SSR patterns
  * Send down initial data and hydrate state

* **Optimizing Renders** (_N/A_)
  * Show off virtualization techniques
    * Have users implement virtualized list as exercise?
  * `PureComponent` and `shouldComponentUpdate`
  * When to optimize (read: not too early)
  * The benefits of immutable data
