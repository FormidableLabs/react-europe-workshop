# Exercise Ideas

Some ideas for exercises. These can be the exercises we do during lectures, or the ones the students do

Render a dynamic table of contents based on the rendered content sections. This could be a cool exercises for Context?


## Compound Components

* Lecture will walk through implementing a Navigation bar. It will use cloneElement, and move to Context, covering "implicit state".
* Exercise will implement a "wizard" with a Wizard/Step component set
